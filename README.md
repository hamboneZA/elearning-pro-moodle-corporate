# Moodle for Corporates

This serves as a custom repo for cloning into a skeleton directory when creating new virtual servers in Cyber Panel. It's very much servicing our clients and may not be suitable for use in all envirnonments.

## Summary

This fork includes some additional default plugins that are useful for corporate and enterprise moodle environments. This repo can replace git clone https://github.com/moodle/moodle.git in the skel.sh script used in https://github.com/hamboneZA/moodle_panel to create new Cyber Panel virtual servers with Moodle pre-configured.

## Usage

If used at all, do so with caution as this is still very much a work in progress. Clone this repo instead of moodle source and install moodle as you normally would. if using <code>non-interactive.sh</code> to create virtual servers be sure to replace the repo fetched by skel.sh in your local version of those scripts.
